Introduction:
This is the project for the paper "Robust Contrast Enhancement Forensics Based on Convolutional Neural Networks" by Wuyang Shan, Yaohua Yi, Ronggang Huang, and Yong Xie.

Terms of use:
1. The code and algorithm in this project are for non-commercial use only.
2. If you use the code in your own project, please cite our paper.

Dependencies:
1. Before you start matlab, you should add the 'caffe_Release' folder to the windows environment variable 'path'. If you have done, please restart matlab.
2. You should add the 'libSVM' folder to your Matlab search PATH.
3. Matlab_R2014a

How to run:
To reproduce the results reported in the paper, run the following files in Matlab:
"plot_globalCE_ROC.m"
"plot_localCE_ROC.m"
"locate_object_withCNN.m"
"locate_object_withSVM.m"
